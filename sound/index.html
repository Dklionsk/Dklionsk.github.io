        <h1>How Sound Moves Through Air</h1>
        <p><canvas id="canvas"></canvas></p>
        <p>When textbooks talk about sound waves, they usually show an image called a "waveform" that looks like this:</p>
        <p>
            <svg viewBox="0 0 602 82" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
                <path d="M1 41C16 21 31 1 51 1C91 1 111 81 151 81C191 81 211 1 251 1C291 1 311 81 351 81C391 81 411 1 451 1C491 1 511 81 551 81C571 81 586 61 601 41" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/>
            </svg>   
        </p>
        <p>Sure, it looks like a "wave", but this is just a graph. What exactly are we looking at? What's happening in the <i>air</i> when a sound wave moves through it?</p>
        <p>Sound waves are <i>pressure waves</i> in the air. When you play sound through a speaker, the speaker vibrates and pushes the air molecules in front of it. Those molecules bounce into the molecules in front of them, and so on, producing a <i>ripple of pressure</i> out from the speaker. When this ripple hits your ear, you hear the sound.</p>
        <p>At the top of the page is a little simulation showing what's happening. On the left is the speaker, vibrating at a fixed rate. The circles are molecules of air, bouncing against the speaker and each other. The speaker produces "ripples" in the air. Note that each air molecule doesn't move to the left or right very far. In other words, when sound travels across the room, air doesn't shoot out from the speaker and go all way to your ear. The ripple of air pressure moves across the room and hits your ear.</p>
        <p>So what are those waveform graphs showing exactly? They're showing the air pressure at your ear over time. Air pressure is higher when molecules of air are pushed closer together and lower when they are spread farther apart. The waveform graph shows how the pressure increases as a sound wave hits your ear and decreases in the gap before the next wave.</p>
