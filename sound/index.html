        <p>
            The most common way to visualize sound is with a graph called a "waveform", but what exactly does that graph represent? What's happening in the <i>air</i> when a sound wave moves through it?
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's an animation that shows another way to visualize sound moving through the air. The circles are air molecules. A speaker somewhere to the left vibrates and pushes on the molecules in front of it at a fixed rate. Those molecules bounce into the molecules next to them, and so on, producing a <i>ripple of higher pressure</i> through the air. When this ripple hits your ear, you hear the sound.
