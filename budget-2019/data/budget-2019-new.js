There's an ongoing debate about how we will continue to fund Social Security. Today's workers pay for today's retirees, and the number of people receiving benefits is increasing relative to the number of workers who contribute through taxes. For example, the average number of workers per retiree was 5.1 in 1960. This declined to 3.0 by 2010, and is projected to decline to 2.2 by 2030. If nothing changes, it's predicted that Social Security will start paying out more than it takes in by 2033. Congress might prevent this shortfall by increasing taxes, decreasing benefits, or a combination of both.",
