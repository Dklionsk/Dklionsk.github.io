    <h4>Sources</h4>
    <p>For fiscal year 2019, the complete US federal budget was passed in three separate bills: <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5895">H.R. 5895</a>, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6157">H.R. 6157</a>, and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-joint-resolution/31">H.J.Res 31</a>.</p>
    <p>While those bills describe all discretionary spending in detail, they don't always show exact amounts for mandatory spending. To fill in the gaps for mandatory items, I referred to reports from the Congressional Research Service:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45230">Agriculture</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45237">Commerce, Justice, Science</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10942">Defense</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45258">Energy, Water</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45295">Financial Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45268">Homeland Security</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44934">Interior, Environment</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45214">Legislative Branch</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45168">State, Foreign Operations</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>To double check larger mandatory items, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, I referred to the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2019-budget-in-brief.pdf">Department of Health and Human Services FY 2019 budget request</a>, as well as the 2019 values from the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/budget-fy2020.pdf">President's budget proposal for FY 2020</a>. Since both documents are budget requests, their discretionary values should be ignored (since they don't necessary match what Congress enacted), but their mandatory values are correct.</p>
    <p>I referred to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_agencies_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia</a> for descriptions of major agencies and sources of spending.</p>
