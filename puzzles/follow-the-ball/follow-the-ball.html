<div class="pageTitle">Follow the Ball</div>

<p><i>The curator of our art gallery was an unusual man. He would only eat hard-boiled eggs,
preferred his coffee almost freezing cold, and, before he died, he started a collection of
children's sing-along videos, the kind where you had to follow the bouncing ball. He would
watch them day and night, looking for patterns, becoming very disagreeable if interrupted for
any reason. After his death we found this page among his things. Maybe you can make some
sense of it.</i></p>
