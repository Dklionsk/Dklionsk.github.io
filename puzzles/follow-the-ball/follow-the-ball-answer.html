<div class="pageTitle">Follow the Ball (Solution)</div>

The title and flavor text hint that "following a bouncing ball", where a ball hits every word, or every letter, is important.<br/>
If you take the capital letters from the note, you get the word "siteswap". Googling this word reveals that it's a numerical notation for describing juggling patterns. Each number indicates how many beats later that ball is thrown again.<br/>
Each of the five numbers before the cryptic lines of text is a siteswap. Cipher's instructions "one letter per throw" and "follow the first ball" indicate that you should apply the siteswap to the text, using only the letters that the first ball lands on.<br/>

This gives the clue "eight five two first sentence", or, apply the siteswap 852 to the first sentence of Cipher's letter.

Over the ash town, I reach a stitch in shadow.

This gives the answer, OSTRICH.
