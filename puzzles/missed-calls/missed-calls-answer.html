<div class="pageTitle">Missed Calls (Solution)</div>
All the names might look familiar - they're all derived from books in the bible. Gene -> Genesis, Dan -> Daniel, Levi -> Leviticus, Josh -> Joshua, Zeke -> Ezekiel. The time they called, in military time, refers to a chapter and verse. Each verse mentions a number. 

<pre>
2, B
Genesis 1:16
And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

12, L
Daniel 4:29
At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.

9, I
Joshua 13:7
Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

7, G
Leviticus 14:38
Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:

8, H
Genesis 17:12
And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.

20, T
Ezekiel 4:10
And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.
</pre>
