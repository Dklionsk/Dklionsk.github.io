<div class="pageTitle">Three Dimensional (Solution)</div>
The key is to realize that the images are depth data, in which black pixels are far and white pixels are near (this is how nearly all depth images work). Each "three-dimensional" slice is an letter rotated 90 degrees clockwise about its vertical axis. Using the depth data in the slice you can draw the right edge of the letter. If you translate each slice in this way you get the message "ringling bros is a famous one", which gives the answer, CIRCUS.
