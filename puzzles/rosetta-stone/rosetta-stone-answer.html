    <p>
        This puzzle was inspired by a trip I took to Russia. I noticed that a lot of popular American chains had
        locations in Russia, but they had translated their logos into Cyrillic. If you were dropped into this country
        and had never seen the Russian alphabet before, you could probably figure out how to read it just by looking at
        these signs and remembering their English names. The logos would act as a sort of modern Rosetta Stone, but for
        Russian instead of ancient Egyptian.

        In this puzzle, you first have to identify the logos and then figure out the <i>sounds</i> represented by the
        glyphs. The glyphs form a substitution cipher, but for sounds instead of letters. For example, instead of
        writing the word "the" with three glyphs for "t", "h", and "e", you would write it with just two, one for "th"
        and another for "uh".

    <p>Logos: Subway, Best Buy, Burger King, Old Navy, Starbucks, Facebook, The Home Depot, Jif</p>

        The completed "alphabet":<br>

        The translated text:<br>
        <img src="400px-Rosetta-Stone-Answer.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        The translated text in English reads: "What is the term for the oval enclosing names in Egypt's hieroglyphs?"

        The answer to this question is CARTOUCHE.
