Recipes are algorithms. You take a bunch of inputs, follow the steps to combine them in various ways, and the output is delicious food. The key idea in this puzzle that simple mathematical algorithms are encoded as recipes. The inputs are the numbers of each ingredient, and whenever some result is �set aside� it is an output. The output of each recipe then is a number or group of numbers. You can tell that math is required from the terminology: add, subtract, divide, set the microwave to a power, etc. Some instructions, like greasing pans and preheating ovens, were just there for flavor. The 35 uncooked fish in the dessert recipe were simply red herrings. The outputs of all recipes, in order and indexed into the alphabet, gives the answer, MANGO.
